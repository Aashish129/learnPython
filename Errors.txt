ISSUE1: THE ERROR: "TYPE STR DOESN'T DEFINE __ROUND__ METHOD"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are trying to use the round() function on userInput, which is a string (str) type. The problem is that strings do not have a __round__ method, which is why Python raises the error. The round() function is designed to work with numeric values like int or float, not strings.

Analogy to Help You Understand:
Imagine you're going to a math class where the teacher asks you to round a number. The teacher says, "Please round the number I give you to the nearest whole number."

Teacher's expectation: The teacher expects a number (let’s say 3.14159, which is the value of Pi), so the teacher can round it to 3.
Your response: You, as the student, give the teacher a piece of paper with words written on it instead of a number—let’s say you hand over a note saying "three point one four".
Teacher's reaction: The teacher doesn't know how to round the piece of paper because it's not a number! The teacher needs a numeric value to round, not text.
In this analogy:

The teacher is the round() function.
The numeric value is what the teacher expects to work with.
The piece of paper with words is the string (str) you gave it instead of a number.
