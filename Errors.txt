ISSUE1: THE ERROR: "TYPE STR DOESN'T DEFINE __ROUND__ METHOD"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are trying to use the round() function on userInput, which is a string (str) type. The problem is that strings do not have a __round__ method, which is why Python raises the error. The round() function is designed to work with numeric values like int or float, not strings.

Analogy to Help You Understand:
Imagine you're going to a math class where the teacher asks you to round a number. The teacher says, "Please round the number I give you to the nearest whole number."

Teacher's expectation: The teacher expects a number (let’s say 3.14159, which is the value of Pi), so the teacher can round it to 3.
Your response: You, as the student, give the teacher a piece of paper with words written on it instead of a number—let’s say you hand over a note saying "three point one four".
Teacher's reaction: The teacher doesn't know how to round the piece of paper because it's not a number! The teacher needs a numeric value to round, not text.
In this analogy:

The teacher is the round() function.
The numeric value is what the teacher expects to work with.
The piece of paper with words is the string (str) you gave it instead of a number.

ISSUE 2: SYNTAXERROR: INVALID SYNTAX. MAYBE YOU MEANT '==' OR ':=' INSTEAD OF '='?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure! Let's break down the error with an analogy to make it easier to understand.

Imagine you're working in a kitchen, and you're following a recipe. You're instructed to check if an ingredient (let's say sugar) is equal to a specific amount (e.g., 1 cup). The correct way to do this in the recipe would be to say, "If the amount of sugar is equal to 1 cup, do this."

Now, imagine you mistakenly wrote the recipe like this:

"If the amount of sugar is 1 cup, do this."
That sentence is wrong because it implies you're setting the amount of sugar to 1 cup, rather than checking if it is equal to 1 cup.

Connecting this to the Python error:
In Python, the line:

python
Copy code
elif name = "Richa":
is attempting to use the assignment operator = (which sets a value) instead of the comparison operator == (which checks equality). This would be like saying, "Set name to 'Richa' and check if that works"—which doesn't make sense in a conditional statement.

How the analogy fits:
= (assignment operator): This is like saying "set"—you're assigning a value to something (in the kitchen analogy, you're putting sugar into a bowl).
== (comparison operator): This is like saying "is equal to"—you're checking if two things are the same (in the kitchen analogy, you're checking if the sugar is exactly 1 cup).
So, the Python error occurs because Python expects to compare the value of name to the string "Richa", but instead, you're trying to assign "Richa" to name using =. This is not a valid operation in the context of a conditional statement.

Correcting the mistake:
To properly compare name with "Richa", you need to use ==, which is the comparison operator, not =:

python
Copy code
elif name == "Richa":
This is like saying, "If the amount of sugar is equal to 1 cup, do this," which makes sense and is the right way to express the condition in the recipe (or the Python code).

Conclusion:
In summary:

= is for assignment (putting something into a variable).
== is for comparison (checking if two things are equal).
The error you're seeing (SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?) is Python pointing out that you're trying to assign a value when you're meant to be checking for equality.
